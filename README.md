Analyzing land displacement of Purace Volcano after December 2025 eruption, using Sentinel-1 SAR data and PyGMTSAR tool


This project analyzes post-eruption ground deformation of Puracé Volcano (Colombia) following the December 2025 eruptive event.

Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were processed using Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques to detect and quantify Line-of-Sight (LOS) surface displacement in millimeters.

The objective was to evaluate surface deformation patterns and assess volcanic ground movement using open satellite data and open-source geospatial tools.
